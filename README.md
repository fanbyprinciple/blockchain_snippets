Ganache simulates an etherium blockchain. It can be achieved in a non gui manner using truffle.

After migration, the app can be deployed to a public network.

Etherium is transaction based state machine

It is cryptographicaly secure

with shared state

For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as mining. Mining is when a group of nodes (i.e. computers) expend their compute resources to create a block of valid transactions.

“GHOST” = “Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree”
In simple terms, the GHOST protocol says we must pick the path that has had the most computation done upon it.

Truffle console is to interact with the blockchchain.

Any node that wants to verify a piece of data can use something called a “Merkle proof” to do so. A Merkle proof consists of:
A chunk of data to be verified and its hash
The root hash of the tree
The “branch” (all of the partner hashes going up along the path from the chunk to the root)
