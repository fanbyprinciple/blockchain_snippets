## Understanding blockchains

Layman terms :  https://thehustle.co/how-are-bitcoin-created/

Proof of work : the computation miner does that assigns a particular code.

When bitcoin mining first started, the reward was 50 bitcoin (BTC). But as dictated by the coin’s creator, the reward is cut in half every time 210k new blocks are added to the chain — or roughly every 4 years.

Last bitcoin be mined by 2140, therefore it is exponentially more computation heavy to mine more bitcoins.
