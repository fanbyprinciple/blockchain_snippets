I am coding a python port of what was represented in the video.

Ganache simulates an etherium blockchain. It can be achieved in a non gui manner using truffle.

After migration, the app can be deployed to a public network.

Cant connect the wallet to gnache. 

connected the wallet from https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/76858/metamask-testrpc-shows-0-ether-while-connecting-to-ganache-cli/116776#116776

when nothing happens on click

start truffle develop on another terminal

in truffle develop wehenver I am typing in adoption the site point to localhost 8545 though gnache address is localhost 7545.

Etherium is transaction based state machine

It is cryptographicaly secure

with shared state

https://preethikasireddy.medium.com/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369

For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as mining. Mining is when a group of nodes (i.e. computers) expend their compute resources to create a block of valid transactions.

“GHOST” = “Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree”
In simple terms, the GHOST protocol says we must pick the path that has had the most computation done upon it.

Truffle console is to interact with the blockchchain.

Any node that wants to verify a piece of data can use something called a “Merkle proof” to do so. A Merkle proof consists of:
A chunk of data to be verified and its hash
The root hash of the tree
The “branch” (all of the partner hashes going up along the path from the chunk to the root)

## Understanding blockchains

Layman terms :  https://thehustle.co/how-are-bitcoin-created/

Proof of work : the computation miner does that assigns a particular code.

When bitcoin mining first started, the reward was 50 bitcoin (BTC). But as dictated by the coin’s creator, the reward is cut in half every time 210k new blocks are added to the chain — or roughly every 4 years.

Last bitcoin be mined by 2140, therefore it is exponentially more computation heavy to mine more bitcoins.
